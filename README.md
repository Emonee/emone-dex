# Emone Dex App

This APP is a quick pokedex of the third generation of the main pokemon game series (Ruby, Saphire, Emerald, Fire red and Leaf green).

This comes from the fact that whenever I play, searching for the data that interests me most about a Pokémon in Encyclopedias is usually very slow. Now I can search for Pokémon very quickly and see their main characteristics!

Any idea of what information to add or new features is welcome.

Gotta catch 'em all!
